# üç∑ Red Wine Quality Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical features.

## Overview
This project uses various classification algorithms to predict wine quality on a scale of 0 to 10. It leverages data such as alcohol content, pH level, sulphates, and citric acid concentration to analyze and classify wine quality.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Records: ~1,600 samples of red wine
- Features: 11 chemical attributes + quality score

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Techniques
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine
- Accuracy & Confusion Matrix for model evaluation

## Results
- Achieved accuracy up to **X%** (update with your actual result)
- Random Forest performed best among tested models
